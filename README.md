# OddEvenSort
Odd even sort is a sorting algorithm that is a variation of bubble sort. The algorithm checks odd and even indexes and if the elements are in wrong order (ith index is greater than ith+1 index) then the elements are swapped. The process continues until all of the data is sorted.

# INPUT
On running the code user is asked for input for the size of the array. The array is then filled with random numbers upto the size of the array and then the algorithm proceeds to sort the data.
